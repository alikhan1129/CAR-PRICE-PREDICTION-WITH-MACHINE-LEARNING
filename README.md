# Car Price Prediction Project

**Overview:**

This Car Price Prediction project represents a critical aspect of my data science journey. It's designed to predict car prices using a variety of data sources, including car specifications, market trends, and historical pricing data. The aim is to create a model that provides accurate price predictions, which can be invaluable for car buyers, sellers, and enthusiasts.

**Key Features:**

- **Data Collection and Cleaning:** The project involved gathering and preprocessing a diverse dataset of car-related information, ensuring data quality and consistency.

- **Machine Learning Models:** I implemented a range of machine learning models, including regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, to predict car prices.

- **Model Evaluation:** Rigorous evaluation of the models was carried out, considering metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared to determine the model's predictive accuracy.

## Dataset

I used a comprehensive dataset that included car specifications, market conditions, and historical pricing data to train and test the predictive models.

## Results

Our Car Price Prediction models achieved impressive results, with low mean squared error and high R-squared values. This demonstrates the model's capability to provide accurate and reliable car price estimates, which can be valuable for potential car buyers and sellers.


### Model Performance Metrics

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 1.0507
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 1.6983
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 1.3032
- **R-squared (R^2) Score:** 0.8709

These metrics reflect the accuracy and reliability of the Car Price Prediction models. A low MAE, MSE, and RMSE, along with a high R-squared score, demonstrate the models' ability to provide precise and valuable car price estimates. These results are particularly useful for potential car buyers and sellers.


## Future Work

In the future, I plan to explore advanced techniques like neural networks and incorporate additional data sources to further enhance the accuracy of car price predictions. Contributions and feedback are welcome to help improve this project.
